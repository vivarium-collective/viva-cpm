"""Crypt differentiation as a process-bigraph ``Composite``.

A single ``CPMProcess`` runs the colonic-crypt Cellular Potts world seeded
from the HRA FTU illustration. The two ``Epithelial Stem`` cells at the crypt
base are a permanent Wnt-secreting niche (they carry no subcell and never
differentiate). Every cell in the *progenitor pool* (the Absorptive cells)
additionally gets two subcellular processes wired to its local environment:

  * an ``SBMLSubcell`` integrating a stemness ODE driven by the local Wnt
    concentration (``field_at_cell`` -> ``ligand``), publishing stemness ``S``;
  * a ``BooleanSubcell`` that reads stemness plus the count of secretory
    neighbours (``neighbor_secretory``) and emits a fate: stay put, become
    goblet (secretory), or become absorptive (Notch-style lateral inhibition).

A progenitor near the base sees high Wnt and keeps ``S`` high (stays
undifferentiated); one farther up sees low Wnt, ``S`` falls below threshold,
and it differentiates. The CPM consumes the per-cell fates on the next update
and relabels cells, so differentiation feeds back into the tissue. The whole
thing is advanced by ``Composite.run`` -- there is no bypass of the engine.
