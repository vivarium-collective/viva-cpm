"""Quantitative validation of each Glazier & Graner (1993) study against the
behaviour the paper reports.

Each study gets ONE acceptance test: a named, paper-grounded assertion evaluated
against the saved metric time series (``workspace/gg1993_data/results/<slug>/
<slug>_series.json``). A test returns the measured quantity, the expected
condition, and PASS/FAIL — no hand-set verdicts, so a regression in the engine
flips the card to FAIL.

Run: ``python -m viva_cpm_studies.gg1993.validate`` — evaluates every study,
prints a table, writes ``workspace/gg1993_data/validation.json``, AND calls
``apply_conclusions()`` to write the derived tests / run outcomes / gate verdict
back into each ``study.yaml``. So the report's conclusions are never hand-set:
re-run the sims (``driver.py``) then re-run this (or the full pipeline,
``python -m viva_cpm_studies.gg1993.gallery``, which calls it) and every study's
"Ran · Tests · Verdict" strip updates automatically from the current data.
