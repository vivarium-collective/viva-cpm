"""3D crypt structure: a procedural single-cell-thick epithelial shell held
together by the connectivity constraint. Builds an OPEN-TOPPED crypt (a test
tube: a closed rounded base holding the stem niche, a cylindrical wall, and an
open mouth that drains into the gut lumen — the real intestinal-crypt shape),
relaxes briefly with connectivity ON (cells + medium), validates that it stays a
coherent monolayer with a deep open lumen, a sealed base, and a basal stem
niche, and exports it for the viewer.
